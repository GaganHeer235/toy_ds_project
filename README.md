    "First, the unprocessed data is imported from github to the notebook as information regarding smoking is not included in the provided processed dataset. After the raw data is imported, due to poor formatting of the data such as a single observation spaning multiple rows, the data regarding the number of years and average number of cigarettes of each patient is extracted. This data is further processed to determine whether a patient has (1) or has never (0) smoked, which is recorded as \"smoker\"."
